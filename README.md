# studio-CMakeModules
A collection of CMakeModules for our own libraries.  Need to reliably locate one of our libraries with CMake?  This is the repository for you.

## Updates
As we update our software, our modules are subject to change at any given time.  Please be advised that mismatching versions between the library and CMake module may cause unexpected issues!

## Found a problem?
Please report it via GitHub's issue tracker.  Make sure you:

- Updated the library
- Updated the CMake module
- Given as much detail as you can

## Have a fix?
We appreciate your work to solve an issue!  Feel free to send a pull request to be reviewed.  Please make sure you:

- Have thoroughly tested it
- Follow the code style (mainly indentation via tabs)
- Mention the issue the PR is solving if applicable

## Want to add a non-Gooborg library?
We have a better repository for that!  Non-Gooborg software is added to our [CMakeModules](https://github.com/GooborgStudios/CMakeModules) repository.
